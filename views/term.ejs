        Thank you for using TrekTribe!
        
        These Terms of Service for Indian Users (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and TrekTribe that govern your right to use the websites,
         applications, and other offerings from TrekTibe (collectively, the “TrekTribe Platform”). When used in these Terms, “TrekTribe,” “we,” “us,” or 
         “our” refers to the TrekTribe entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.
        
        The TrekTribe Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. 
        Members who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions and events (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a “Listing”). 
        As the provider of the TrekTribe Platform, Airbnb does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings, Host Services, or tourism services. TrekTribe is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Airbnb a real estate broker, travel agency,
         insurer or an organiser or retailer of travel packages under Directive (IU) 2015/2302. TrekTribe is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”). To learn more about TrekTribe’s role see Section 17.</p>

         <p>We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, 
            which govern any payment services provided to Members by the TrekTribe payment entities (collectively "TrekTribe Payments").</p>
